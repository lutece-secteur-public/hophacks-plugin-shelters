# Plugin shelters

## Introduction

This application aims to provide a realtime information about beds availability in shelters for homeless people.

## Configuration

The administrator should connect to the Lutece Back Office through the URL :

```
http://myhost:myport/mycontext/jsp/admin/AdminLogin.jsp
```

First, the administrator should create a workgroup for each shelter using the feature "Managers/Workgroups Management".

Then the administrator should create all the shelters in the backoffice choosing the feature "Manage Shelters" and select for each one the corresponding workgroup previously created.

Finally, the administrator should create an user account per shelter with the feature "Managers/Users management" and for each give the right only to the "Manage Bed Availability" and add the user to the right Workgroup using once again the feature "Managers/Workgroups Management".

## Usage

```
http://myhost:myport/mycontext/jsp/site/Portal.jsp?page=shelters
```
